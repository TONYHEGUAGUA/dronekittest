    """
    Move vehicle in direction based on specified velocity vectors and
    for the specified duration.

    This uses the SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED command with a type mask enabling only 
    velocity components 
    (http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/copter-commands-in-guided-mode/#set_position_target_local_ned).
    
    Note that from AC3.3 the message should be re-sent every second (after about 3 seconds
    with no message the velocity will drop back to zero). In AC3.2.1 and earlier the specified
    velocity persists until it is canceled. The code below should work on either version 
    (sending the message multiple times does not cause problems).
    
    See the above link for information on the type_mask (0=enable, 1=ignore). 
    At time of writing, acceleration and yaw bits are ignored.

def condition_yaw(heading, relative=False):
    """
    Send MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW message to point vehicle at a specified heading (in degrees).

    This method sets an absolute heading by default, but you can set the `relative` parameter
    to `True` to set yaw relative to the current yaw heading.

    By default the yaw of the vehicle will follow the direction of travel. After setting 
    the yaw using this function there is no way to return to the default yaw "follow direction 
    of travel" behaviour (https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/issues/2427)
